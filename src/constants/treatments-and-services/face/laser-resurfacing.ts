  "Your skin is constantly shedding off old cells to make way for younger and brighter skin cells. This process slows down significantly as you age, which is why you see so many uneven tone and texture features when you’re older than you had with younger skin.",
  "Laser resurfacing reinvigorates your skin by removing the dead and tired skin cells using heat, which allows the new cells to rise to the surface for a clearer complexion. The procedure uses the Fraxel® laser system, which is nonablative. Nonablative lasers like Fraxel also stimulate collagen production below your skin’s surface to increase firmness over time.",
  "Fraxel laser resurfacing creates microscopic columns using hair-thin beams of laser light. This allows the skin around those columns to heal with minimal side effects and recovery time. Most people benefit from four to six Fraxel laser resurfacing treatments.",

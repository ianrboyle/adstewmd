export const whatIsJeuveauTitle = "What is Jeuveau?";

export const whatIsJeuveauBody = [
  "Jeuveau, also called NEWTOX, is a popular neuromodulator that softens frown lines between the eyebrows. An injectable medication, Jeuveau targets the muscles beneath the skin to inhibit muscle movement. The skin on top relaxes, causing the glabellar lines (the “eleven” wrinkles) to subside temporarily.",
];

export const howDoesJeuveauWorkTitle = "How does Jeuveau work?";
export const howDoesJeuveauWorkBody = [
  "When injected, Jeuveau interferes with the nerve signals that tell the muscles to contract. The treatment temporarily paralyzes muscle movement, causing the skin atop to unfold. Within three days to a week, the skin appears smoother and more youthful. Jeuveau can address existing fine lines and wrinkles while preventing new ones from forming.",
];

export const howIsJeuveauDifferentTitle = "How is Jeuveau different from Botox Cosmetic?";
export const howIsJeuveauDifferentBody = [
  "Jeuveau and Botox Cosmetic share many similarities. However, Botox can treat a wider range of treatment areas than Jeuveau. While Jeuveau is currently FDA-approved to address glabellar lines, Botox treats frown lines as well as crow’s feet and forehead lines. Botox can also minimize the symptoms of migraines and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).",
  "Jeuveau typically costs slightly less than Botox and lasts just as long. It’s an effective treatment for individuals who have received Botox in the past and are no longer satisfied with their results. After a cosmetic consultation, Dr. Stewart can determine whether Jeuveau or Botox is best for you.",
];

export const whatDoesJeuveauAddressTitle = "What types of wrinkles can Jeuveau address?";
export const whatDoesJeuveauAddressBody = [
  "Jeuveau addresses dynamic wrinkles. Also called expression lines, dynamic wrinkles develop from repeated muscle movement. Targeting the muscles that control skin folding allows the wrinkles to soften. Jeuveau can also prevent fine lines from deepening by slowing the muscle contractions in that area.",
];

export const whatCanIExpectJeuveauTitle = "What can I expect from Jeuveau treatments?";
export const whatCanIExpectJeuveauBody = [
  "Jeuveau treatments require no preparation and take only a few minutes to inject. Dr. Stewart may apply a topical anesthetic to keep you comfortable before injecting the medication into the predetermined areas. You may experience minor swelling, bruising, and redness at the injection sites, but these side effects subside within a few days.",
];

export const howLongDoesJeuveauLastTitle = "How long does Jeuveau last?";
export const howLongDoesJeuveauLastBody = [
  "Jeuveau lasts for about three to four months before gradually wearing off. You can return to Aesthetic Surgery and Dermatology for additional treatments to maintain your results. Dr. Stewart may also recommend combining your treatments with complementary cosmetic procedures to enhance your appearance.",
  "Jeuveau is an effective alternative to Botox for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. If you’re interested in Jeuveau treatments, call Aesthetic Surgery and Dermatology of Cherry Creek today or schedule an appointment online.",

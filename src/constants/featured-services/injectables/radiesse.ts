export const whatIsRadiesseBody = [
  "Radiesse is a dermal filler and collagen stimulator that reduces the appearance of wrinkles and restores fullness to the skin. While Radiesse is suitable for the hands and other areas of the body, it’s most effective at treating facial lines around the nose and mouth. The filler is biocompatible with the body’s tissues and breaks down naturally over time.",

export const howIsRadiesseDifferentTitle = "How is Radiesse different from other fillers?";
export const howIsRadiesseDifferentBody = [
  "Most fillers rely on a hyaluronic acid formulation to plump up the skin instantly, but Radiesse takes a long-term approach to wrinkle reduction. Radiesse contains calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres suspended in an aqueous gel to provide structure and support for the skin. In addition to enhancing the skin with natural-looking volume, Radiesse stimulates collagen production. Collagen is a protein in your tissues that keeps your skin tight and firm. As you age, collagen levels plummet, causing your skin to wrinkle and sag. Radiesse replaces lost collagen over time. As the filler naturally degrades, the microspheres break down and stimulate new collagen.",

  "While Radiesse treatments require no formal preparation, there are a few steps you can take to ensure a safe, effective outcome.

She then injects the medication into the predetermined areas. While you may experience minor bruising, redness, and swelling, these side effects usually subside within a few days.

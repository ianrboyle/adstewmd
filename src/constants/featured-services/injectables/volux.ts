  "Juvéderm Volux XC is an FDA-approved dermal filler for jawline and chin enhancement.

Many men and women choose Juvéderm Volux to achieve a chiseled jawline and improve facial harmony.",

export const howDoesVoluxWorkTitle = "How does Juvéderm Volux work?";
export const howDoesVoluxWorkBody = [
  "Juvéderm Volux uses VYCROSS® technology and a biodegradable compound called BDDE, which crosslinks hyaluronic acid for an ultra-smooth filler. Crosslinked hyaluronic acid is more durable and stable than the substance in its rawest form, making it ideal for subtly enhancing the jawline and chin.",

  "Dr. Stewart and her aesthetic team use an ultra-fine needle or a cannula, a thin, flexible tube, to safely deliver the filler into the lower face. Juvéderm Volux also contains lidocaine to minimize pain and sensitivity for a comfortable treatment.",

export const whatDoesVoluxAddressTitle = "What areas can Juvéderm Volux treat?";
export const whatDoesVoluxAddressMainBody = [
  "Volux specifically enhances the chin and jawline, which can lose volume as you age. This special formulation provides structure for your lower face. When volume in your midface and jawline depletes, your skin starts to sag, leading to jowl formations. Juvéderm Volux essentially provides scaffolding for the skin to lift and tighten the chin and jawline.",

  "Volux can also temporarily reduce the appearance of a double chin by providing a lifting effect. This treatment is ideal if you want a smoother chin and jawline but are not interested in fat-dissolving treatments, like Kybella®, or facelift surgery.",

export const howToPrepareVoluxBody = [
  "If you schedule a cosmetic consultation before your injection visit, Dr. Stewart can offer personalized advice to prepare.",

  "To minimize bruising, avoid blood thinners for at least a few days before treatment. If you use retinoids or acid-based products, Dr. Stewart may recommend taking a break for a day or two. Arnica is an excellent supplement to take before using injectables to reduce swelling and bruising.",

  "While the lidocaine in Juvéderm Volux can enhance your comfort during treatment, Dr. Stewart may also apply a topical numbing cream before your injections. Once you’re comfortable, she injects the medication into the predetermined areas. You can see the results immediately, though you may experience temporary bruising, swelling, and redness.",

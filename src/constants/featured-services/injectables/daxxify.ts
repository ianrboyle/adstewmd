  "Daxxify, formerly called DAXI, is a new neuromodulator by Revance Aesthetics that is FDA-approved to treat moderate to severe glabellar lines between the eyebrows. Powered by a proprietary peptide formula, Daxxify is currently the longest-lasting neuromodulator available. The medication’s extended results can lead to less frequent treatments and fewer injections.",

export const howIsDaxxifyDifferentTitle = "How is Daxxify different from Botox Cosmetic?";
export const howIsDaxxifyDifferentBody = [
  "The main difference between Daxxify and Botox Cosmetic is duration. Daxxify has been shown to last at least three months longer than Botox in many clinical studies.",
  "Botox and other popular neuromodulators contain human serum albumin, a component found in human blood. Daxxify, on the other hand, contains no human or animal ingredients. Instead, it uses a formulation of peptides for longer staying power. Botox is also most effective when refrigerated, while Daxxify can remain at room temperature.",

export const whatDoesDaxxifyAddressTitle = "What types of wrinkles can Daxxify address?";
export const whatDoesDaxxifyAddressBody = [
  "Daxxify is currently FDA-approved to soften glabellar lines between the eyebrows. Also called “elevens” or frown lines, these wrinkles form when you furrow your brow. Glabellar lines are dynamic wrinkles, meaning they form from repeated muscle movement.",
  "Expressions such as frowning, smiling, and laughing cause the skin to fold. During youth, your skin bounces back to its natural shape at rest. Over time, however, these lines can appear even when you aren’t making an expression. Daxxify prevents muscle contractions to stop the skin from folding, allowing frown lines to relax.",

export const whatCanIExpectDaxxifyBody = [
  "Daxxify treatments require no preparation. They’re perfect as quick lunchtime treatments if you have a busy schedule. When you arrive for your cosmetic consultation, discuss your concerns, goals, and expectations with Dr. Stewart. She then maps out the best injection sites for your needs.",
  "Injecting Daxxify takes only a few minutes. While most people find the treatment comfortable without anesthetics, Dr. Stewart may apply a topical numbing cream before injecting the medication.",
  "You may experience minor swelling, bruising, and redness at the injection site, but these effects should subside within a few days. Similar to Botox, Daxxify’s effects are noticeable within one to seven days of injection.",

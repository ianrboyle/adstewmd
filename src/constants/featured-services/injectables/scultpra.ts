  "Sculptra is a one-of-a-kind cosmetic injectable that boosts collagen production deep within your skin. Collagen is a fibrous protein that gives your skin structure and keeps it firm, but your skin doesn’t produce as much collagen in your later years as it does when you’re young.",

  "Sculptra is similar to dermal fillers but contains an essential ingredient called poly-L-lactic acid. It’s biocompatible and won’t cause an adverse reaction in your skin as it stimulates the production of collagen fibers.",

  "With personalized Sculptra injections, you can enjoy a more youthful appearance with plump skin and minimized wrinkles. The results appear gradually over time as collagen increases, which makes them look distinctively natural compared to the effects of conventional dermal fillers.",

  "Vanquish is a body contouring treatment that targets fat under your skin using radiofrequency, a gentle form of energy that passes through your skin without harming it. The energy warms the fat cells just under your skin to about 120 degrees, which damages those cells beyond repair. After that, your lymphatic system can naturally flush out those cells to give you a trimmer figure.",
  "The Vanquish handpiece never makes contact with your skin. Your specialist at Aesthetic Surgery and Dermatology passes it over your skin as the device calculates the amount of energy required to warm the fat in a particular area.",
  "Weeks or months after your Vanquish procedure, you can see the full effect of your body contouring treatments. You can maintain those results by adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.",

  "Most people benefit from four 45-minute Vanquish treatments spaced about a week apart, but options are flexible based on your starting point and goals.",
  "During each session, you lay on a bed as your specialist situates the device a few inches over your skin. The sessions are comfortable enough to relax, read a book, or close your eyes throughout the process. Vanquish doesn’t cause any pain, but you may feel a warming sensation due to the heat from the radiofrequency.",
  "There is no need for downtime after a Vanquish treatment, but you might experience some light inflammation in the treated areas briefly after your visit. If you have any questions about what to expect during or after your Vanquish treatments, you may ask your specialist ahead of time.",

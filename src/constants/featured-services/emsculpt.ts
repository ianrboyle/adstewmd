  "EMsculpt Neo is an innovative body sculpting treatment to improve your physique in multiple ways simultaneously. It’s a great alternative to liposuction and other fat reduction surgeries for those who either cannot or would rather not undergo surgery. Not only does it remove unwanted body fat, but it also helps you build and define muscle.",

  "The EMsculpt Neo procedure combines two different mechanisms for unmatched body contouring results. It uses radiofrequency to melt down fat cells while increasing your skin’s supply of collagen and elastin fibers while transmitting high-intensity electromagnetic waves to contract, strengthen, and tone your muscles.",

  "During an initial consultation, your specialist at Aesthetic Surgery and Dermatology of Cherry Creek helps you decide which areas to target so they can customize your treatment plan accordingly.",

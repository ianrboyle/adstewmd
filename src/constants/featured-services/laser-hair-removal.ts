export const howDoesItWorkTitle = "How Does Laser Hair Removal Work?";
export const howDoesItWorkBody = [
  "Laser hair removal gets to the root of the problem – literally. During the treatment, a laser emits light energy that heats up and destroys hair follicles, preventing future hair growth. The process focuses on the pigment in the hair, so the laser can target the follicle without harming the surrounding skin.",
  "Over time, and with multiple sessions, the treated hair begins to shed and becomes thinner, leading to long-term hair reduction. Since hair grows in cycles, multiple treatments are necessary to catch all the follicles during their active growth phase. Each session brings you closer to smooth, hair-free skin.",

  "It’s important to follow your pre-procedure instructions before you undergo laser hair removal at Aesthetic Surgery and Dermatology of Cherry Creek. Protect your skin from the sun, avoid other hair removal methods for several weeks, and shave the treatment area the day before your scheduled treatment if asked to.",

  "Before laser hair removal, your specialist numbs the treatment area to keep you comfortable. While you relax and wear glasses to protect your eyes from the laser, they use a handheld device to emit laser energy into targeted hair follicles.
